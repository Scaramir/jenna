# Quantification of organoid-images

## Colocalization of diffrent markers and their percentual colocalization
Threshold four ``.tif``-files per organoid. 
Obtain a lot of values from the images and compare them by all cell lines within each folder of a condition
Compare also the cell lines over different treatments/conditions. Those different treatments need to be stored in seperate folders.
